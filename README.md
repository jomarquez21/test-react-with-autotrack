This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This repository is created to provide a small reproducer using react and react-router-dom, in order to validate that "urlChangeTracker" plugin of "autotrack" dependency reacts to the change of window.history in a single page application.

You need to add a "GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID" at [analytics.js](https://github.com/jomarquez21/test-react-with-autotrack/blob/master/src/analytics.js) before starting the project.

This project adds the "mediaQueryTracker" plugin just to confirm that "autotrack" dependency works correctly.
